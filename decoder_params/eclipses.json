This alignment needs to be *very* precise.* **Why it happens:**    * **New Moon:** Solar eclipses only occur during the new moon phase. During this phase, the moon is between the Earth and the sun, and the side of the moon facing us is not illuminated by the sun.    * **Orbital Plane Tilt:** The moons orbit around the Earth is tilted by about 5 degrees relative to the Earths orbit around the sun (the ecliptic).  This tilt means that most of the time, the moon passes *above* or *below* the sun during a new moon.    * **Perfect Alignment:**  Only when the moons orbit is aligned almost perfectly with the Earth",
